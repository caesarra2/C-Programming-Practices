# Programming tasks with provided solutions in C language.

### Task #1 - Focusing on: Basic console input & output, Understanding arithmetic operations.<br>

Write a short program that asks for your height in feet and inches and your weight in pounds. (Use three variables to store the information.)<br>
Have the program report your body mass index (BMI). To calculate the BMI, first convert your height in feet and inches to your height in inches (1 foot = 12 inches).<br>
Then convert your height in inches to your height in meters by multiplying it by 0.0254. Then convert your weight in pounds into your mass in kilograms by dividing by 2.205.<br>
Finally, compute your BMI by dividing your mass in kilograms by the square of your height in meters.<br>

<br>

An example what the user could see in the console:
`Please enter your height in feet: 5
Now please enter the inches: 8
Please enter your weight in pounds: 165

According to your parameters, your BMI is: 25.083613`
